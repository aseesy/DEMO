# Image Recommendations for LiaiZen Landing Page

Based on Reddit/Facebook research into high-conflict co-parenting pain points, here are images that will emotionally resonate with your audience.

---

## 🎯 KEY PRINCIPLE: Show Relief, Not Perfection

Your audience doesn't want to see:
- ❌ Perfect, smiling co-parents being best friends
- ❌ Corporate stock photos of "diverse teams"
- ❌ Overly staged "happy divorced family"

They WANT to see:
- ✅ Real moments of relief/peace
- ✅ Protection from chaos
- ✅ Visual metaphors for "buffer" and "breathing room"
- ✅ Authentic emotional states (tired → calm, stressed → peaceful)

## 📍 HERO SECTION (Currently has placeholder shield icon)

### Option 1: "The Exhale" Moment
**Image:** Close-up of parent's face, eyes closed, deep breath, phone in hand but screen down
- **Emotion:** Relief, peace, centering
- **Message:** "This is what it feels like to have LiaiZen"
- **Style:** Natural lighting, authentic, not posed
- **Diversity:** Rotate through different genders, ethnicities, ages

### Option 2: Split Screen Transformation
**Image:** Left: stressed parent staring at phone (tension in face) → Right: same parent, relaxed, looking away from phone
- **Emotion:** Before/after, hope, change
- **Message:** "LiaiZen creates the space between trigger and response"
- **Visual cue:** Maybe subtle glow/filter between the two images

### Option 3: Abstract Protection Visual
**Image:** Simple illustration of message bubbles with a soft filter/shield between them
- **Emotion:** Protection, mediation, buffer
- **Message:** "AI that sits between you and the chaos"
- **Style:** Modern, minimalist, calming colors (teal/white)

### Option 4: Parent + Child (Not Looking at Phone)
**Image:** Parent and child together (reading, cooking, playing), phone visible but face-down/ignored
- **Emotion:** Present parenting, peace, priorities
- **Message:** "Get your focus back where it belongs"
- **Key:** Phone is in frame but NOT the focus

---

## 📍 "YOU'VE ALREADY SPENT THOUSANDS" SECTION

### Recommended Visual: Cost/Stress Illustration
**Image:** Simple icons showing money flying away + stressed person
- **Style:** Illustrated (not photo) to avoid being too heavy
- **Elements:** Dollar signs, calendar with court dates, phone with angry emoji
- **Mood:** Frustration but not despair
- **Purpose:** Validate the financial + emotional toll

---

## 📍 "STUCK IN PARALLEL PARENTING" SECTION (Dark teal background)

### Recommended Visual: The Dread Moment
**Image:** Parent in bed at night, dim lighting, phone notification glowing, face showing anxiety/dread
- **Emotion:** The exact moment they recognize (inbox dread, sleepless night)
- **Message:** "We know this feeling"
- **Style:** Moody, authentic, relatable
- **Alternative:** Illustrated version if photo feels too intense

### Option 2: Walking on Eggshells (Literal Visual Metaphor)
**Image:** Illustration or stylized photo of eggshells on ground, careful footsteps
- **Emotion:** Caution, fear of triggering, tension
- **Message:** "You shouldn't have to walk on eggshells in your own conversations"
- **Style:** Artistic, metaphorical

---

## 📍 HOW IT WORKS / FEATURES SECTION

### Recommended: Simple Product Screenshots or UI Mockups
**Image:** Clean mockups showing:
1. Message being typed → AI suggestion appearing
2. Tone meter showing "high conflict" → "neutral"

**Purpose:** Show the actual mechanism without being too technical
**Style:** Bright, clean, hopeful UI design

## 🚫 IMAGES TO AVOID

❌ **Angry/yelling parents** (reinforces negativity, doesn't show solution)
❌ **Crying children** (too heavy, guilt-inducing)
❌ **Courtroom/gavel imagery** (scary, adversarial)
❌ **Generic "tech startup" stock photos** (disconnected from emotion)
❌ **Overly happy divorced families** (feels fake, alienating)
❌ **Phones with angry message screenshots** (triggering, not hopeful)

## 🎯 PRIORITY ORDER

If you can only add ONE image type, start here:

1. **Hero visual** (shield/protection icon → real "exhale" photo)
2. **Parallel parenting section** (dread moment or walking on eggshells)
3. **Product screenshots** (show how it actually works)
4. **Before/after transformation** (stressed → peaceful)

---

## 📊 A/B TESTING IDEAS

Once you have images, test:
- Photo vs. illustration
- Person-focused vs. abstract metaphor
- Before/after vs. single moment of peace
- With vs. without visible phone in frame

Track which drives higher conversion on "Get Started" CTA.

---

## ✅ NEXT STEPS

1. Review these recommendations
2. Choose 2-3 priority images to add first
3. Source or commission images
4. Add to `/public/images/` folder
5. Update LandingPage.jsx with actual image tags
6. Test on mobile (images should enhance, not slow down)
7. Add proper alt text for accessibility

---

**Remember:** The right image will make someone stop scrolling and think *"That's exactly how I feel."* That moment of recognition is what converts.
