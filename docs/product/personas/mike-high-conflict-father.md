## Communication Struggles & Real Costs

### Words Used Against Him

- Everything he says gets misinterpreted and escalated
- His straightforward "No, that doesn't work for me" is read as hostile and dismissive
- Brief texts come across as uncaring when he's just trying to be efficient
- Inability to express himself clearly damages relationships with ex-wife AND children

### Constant Accusations

- Ex-wife claims he "never responds" to messages (he does, just not her preferred way)
- Accused of being "difficult" when simply stating availability
- Every interaction leaves him feeling like he's failing, even when trying his best

### Missing His Kids' Lives

- Missed son's **championship soccer game** because message was buried in 47-text argument about summer vacation
- Daughter's **parent-teacher conference happened without him** - he was on construction site with spotty service
- Losing precious moments because communication is broken

### Can't Say What He Means

- Not good with words
- Explaining work schedule conflicts comes out sounding harsh
- Can't express hurt about kids not mentioning their weekend without sounding accusatory
- Inability to communicate "lawyer/judge way" is literally costing him time with children

### Draining His Savings

- Spent **$12,000 in legal fees** past year, much because communication is too toxic
- Lawyer charges **$350/hour** to help respond to ex-wife's messages
- Can't afford to keep fighting, can't afford to stop fighting for his kids

### Reliving the Same Arguments

- Every conversation about present becomes trial about the past
- Ex brings up things he said three years ago
- Reinterprets his intentions based on old conflicts
- Can't move forward because she won't let the past go

### Never Reaching Resolution

- Can't agree on anything: pickup times, holiday schedules, school decisions
- Everything turns into a fight that goes nowhere
- Exhausted from trying to coordinate basic parenting with someone who treats every interaction as battlefield

> "I missed my son's championship game because I couldn't find the message about the time. It was buried in a 47-message argument about summer vacation."

## Design Implications

### For AI Mediation

- Needs **tone softening** without changing meaning
- Should **preserve brevity** while adding warmth
- Must help him express **emotions he can't articulate**
- Should flag when message might be **misinterpreted** before sending

### For UX

- **Simple, low-tech interface** - he's not tech-savvy
- **Clear, prominent notifications** - can't miss important messages
- **Offline/low-bandwidth support** - construction site reality
- **Quick reply options** - efficient for someone who doesn't like typing

### For Onboarding

- **Simple signup** - don't overwhelm with options
- **Phone-based** - primary device
- **Immediate value** - show how AI helps his messages land better
- **No judgment** - he's already feeling like a failure

### For Legal/Custody Support

- **Easy export** of communication history
- **Timestamps** are critical
- **Show cooperation attempts** clearly
- **Document his responsiveness** (when he does respond)

## Key Insight: The Direct Communicator

Mike represents users who are **direct communicators in a context that punishes directness**. He's not hostile - he's efficient. But efficiency in co-parenting communication reads as coldness or dismissiveness.

LiaiZen needs to help Mike be **warm without being wordy**, and **clear without being harsh**.
