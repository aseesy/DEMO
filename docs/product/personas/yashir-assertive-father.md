## What Yashir Needs From LiaiZen

### Core Needs

1. **Simple UI** - Clear, uncluttered interface
2. **Neutral prompts** - Language that doesn't sound corrective
3. **Short, direct inputs** - Space for brief responses
4. **Options instead of constraints** - Choices rather than directives
5. **Recognition of autonomy** - Validation that he's capable

### AI Coaching Language for Yashir

| Instead of...            | Try framing as...                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "This sounds defensive"  | "Here are some options that preserve your point while reducing escalation" |
| "You're being combative" | "This version maintains your autonomy while improving clarity"             |
| "That's too harsh"       | "Here's an alternative that keeps your intent but reduces defensiveness"   |
| "Don't be reactive"      | "These options give you space to respond thoughtfully"                     |

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Simple interface** - Avoid complexity that feels controlling
- **Neutral language** - No corrective-sounding prompts

## Relationship to Athena

### Dynamic Summary

| Yashir's Perspective          | Athena's Perspective                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| "She's correcting me"         | "I'm clarifying to ensure understanding"   |
| "She's telling me what to do" | "I want logical, child-centered decisions" |
| "She's trying to control me"  | "I need structure and predictability"      |
| "She's attacking me"          | "I'm trying to avoid escalation"           |

### Communication Loop to Break

```
Athena: Clarifying/logical message →
Yashir: Perceives as correction/direction →
Yashir: Defensive/combative response →
Athena: Over-explains to clarify intent →
Yashir: Perceives as more control →
[Loop continues]
```

### LiaiZen's Role

**Not to take sides** - but to help break the loop by:

- Helping Yashir receive information without perceiving attack
- Helping Athena communicate clarity without sounding directive
- Creating space for both to be heard and respected
