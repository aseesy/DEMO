## Communication Struggles & Real Costs

### Small Misunderstandings That Add Up

- Even amicable co-parenting has communication gaps
- Last month: showed up to soccer game ex-wife already attended - **wasted 2 hours driving**
- Son needed permission slips signed by both parents - **deadline passed** because message got lost in casual text thread

### Scattered Information, Constant Questions

- Uses text, email, and notes interchangeably
- Ex-wife asks "What's the new dentist's number?" **for the third time this year**
- Has to dig through months of texts to find when they discussed summer camp last year
- Disorganization wastes time and creates friction even in low-conflict relationship

### Partners Left Out

- New wife wants to help coordinate schedules but **has no visibility** into what's been discussed
- Ex-wife's husband sometimes **duplicates purchases** (two new soccer cleats)
- No one knows who's handling what
- Even amicable co-parenting gets messy without clear system

### Tension Creeps In

- Generally respectful, but occasional tone misunderstandings happen
- Brief "Can't do Tuesday" text felt dismissive when he was just rushed
- Ex sometimes interprets questions as criticism when he's just coordinating
- Even healthy co-parents benefit from communication that reduces misunderstanding

### No Way to Track Success

- Actually good at this, but no way to see progress or patterns
- If they ever need to demonstrate collaborative approach (ex considering relocation), no organized record
- Their **success is invisible** because it's scattered across platforms

| ---------------------------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Texts and emails interchangeably         | Daily        | Creates scattered records         |
| Re-asks questions because answers buried | Weekly       | Wastes time, minor frustration    |
| Uses kids as messengers                  | Sometimes    | Easier but not ideal              |
| Small frustrations quickly resolved      | Occasionally | But still annoying                |

## Goals

### Primary Goals

1. Maintain healthy communication while adding organization and efficiency
2. Reduce time wasted on miscommunication and duplicate efforts
3. Have transparency that includes new partners without awkwardness
4. Prevent small misunderstandings before they cause friction
5. Reference communication history and collaborative patterns when needed

### Underlying Need

**David needs organization, not intervention** - he doesn't need AI to fix hostile messages, he needs a system that keeps information accessible and partners informed.

## Jobs-to-be-Done

1. **When** I need to find information from past conversations, **I want to** search quickly **so that** I don't waste time digging through scattered platforms.

2. **When** my wife wants to help with coordination, **I want to** give her visibility **so that** she can participate without awkwardness.

3. **When** we need to demonstrate our co-parenting approach, **I want to** show our history **so that** we have documentation if ever needed.

4. **When** a message might be misinterpreted, **I want to** soften my tone **so that** small misunderstandings don't create friction.

5. **When** coordinating schedules, **I want to** have a shared system **so that** we don't duplicate efforts or miss events.

## Quotes (Synthesized from Persona)

> "We're actually pretty good at this, but I wish we had a system. I've asked her for the dentist's number three times this year."

> "My wife wants to help with the kids' schedules, but she has no idea what's been discussed. It's awkward."

> "We drove to the same soccer game from opposite sides of town last weekend. Nobody's fault, we just didn't coordinate."

> "I don't need a tool that thinks we're fighting. We're not. We just need to be more organized."

## Design Implications

### For UX

- **Don't assume conflict** - product shouldn't feel like therapy
- **Organization-first** - search, categorization, shared access
- **Family calendar** - shared visibility for all parties
- **Contact management** - centralized shared contacts

### For AI Mediation

- **Optional, not intrusive** - David rarely needs message rewriting
- **Tone check as option** - available but not pushy
- **Pattern recognition** - might catch occasional misinterpretation risk
- **Not conflict-focused** - just communication enhancement

### For Partner Access

- **Tiered permissions** - new partners can see schedules, maybe not all messages
- **Non-awkward invitation** - easy to add without feeling weird
- **Clear boundaries** - what partners can/can't see

### For Documentation

- **Clean export** - organized records if ever needed
- **Searchable history** - find anything quickly
- **Categories/tags** - organize by topic (medical, school, activities)
- **Shared folders** - documents both parents need

## Key Insight: The Maintenance User

David represents **users who don't need rescue, they need maintenance**. He's not in crisis - he's just looking for a better system than scattered texts and emails.

This persona is important because:

1. **Validates the platform isn't just for "broken" families** - healthy co-parents benefit too
2. **Lowers stigma** - "I use LiaiZen" doesn't mean "we're fighting"
3. **Retention opportunity** - low-conflict users are stable, long-term customers
4. **Word-of-mouth** - healthy users recommend to both struggling AND non-struggling friends

| **Consideration** | "Do we really need a co-parenting app?"       | It's not therapy, it's efficiency |
| **Trial**         | "Let's try it for the shared calendar"        | Quick win on organization         |
| **Adoption**      | "This is way better than scattered texts"     | Information always findable       |
