## Core Principles

### Sender-First, Private Coaching Model

1. AI suggestions are **private to the sender only** - never shared with recipient
2. Sender retains **full control** over final message
3. AI helps sender express themselves better, never dictates what to say
4. Focus on **preserving intent** while improving delivery
5. **Educational component** - explain WHY certain phrases escalate

## Hostile Communication Patterns

### Pattern 1: "Always/Never" Statements

**What it is**: Absolute language that overgeneralizes behavior

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "You're ALWAYS late" | Dismisses any time they were on time, feels like attack |
| "You NEVER help" | Ignores all contributions, feels unfair |
| "You always do this" | Vague accusation that can't be addressed |
| "You never listen to me" | Sweeping generalization that invites defensiveness |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- Focus on the **specific current situation**
- Use **"this time"** or **"today"** instead of "always/never"
- State the **impact** rather than the pattern

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "You're ALWAYS late" | "I need you to be on time for Friday's pickup at 5pm" |
| "You NEVER help with homework" | "Can you help Emma with her math homework on your nights?" |
| "You always forget" | "Please remember to send his medication this weekend" |

---

### Pattern 2: Blame and Accusation

**What it is**: Assigning fault rather than solving problems

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "This is YOUR fault" | Triggers defensive response |
| "You caused this" | Past-focused, not solution-focused |
| "Because of you, now..." | Assigns blame, ignites conflict |
| "If you hadn't..." | Counterfactual accusation |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- Focus on **what needs to happen** not who caused the problem
- Use **"I" statements** about impact
- Move toward **solution** not blame

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "This is your fault she's upset" | "Emma seems upset. Can we talk about how to help her?" |
| "Because of you, we missed the deadline" | "The deadline passed. How can we handle this now?" |
| "You caused this whole mess" | "Let's focus on what we can do from here" |

---

### Pattern 3: Triangulation (Speaking Through/For Children)

**What it is**: Using children as messengers or evidence in parental conflicts

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "She told me you didn't feed her dinner" | Uses child as reporter, implies neglect |
| "The kids say they don't like it there" | Weaponizes children's statements |
| "He came home crying because of you" | Blames parent via child's emotions |
| "Tell your father..." | Uses child as messenger |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- Speak about **your own observations and needs**
- Don't relay children's complaints as accusations
- Address issues **directly** between co-parents

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "She told me you didn't make her lunch" | "Can we coordinate on lunch plans for school days?" |
| "The kids say they're bored at your place" | "What activities do you have planned for the weekend?" |
| "He said you yelled at him" | "Jake seemed upset when he came home. Is everything okay?" |

---

### Pattern 4: Past Weaponization

**What it is**: Bringing up old grievances in current discussions

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "Just like when you..." | Drags up irrelevant history |
| "This is the same thing you did in 2019" | Prevents present-focus |
| "You've always been..." | Character attack based on history |
| "Remember when you forgot..." | Uses past failure as weapon |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- Keep focus on **present situation only**
- Acknowledge the past exists without relitigating it
- Redirect to **current actionable request**

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "Just like when you forgot her birthday" | "Please confirm you have her birthday party at 2pm Saturday" |
| "You've always been unreliable" | "Can you confirm the pickup time?" |
| "This is the same thing you did last year" | "I need clarity on this year's holiday schedule" |

---

### Pattern 5: Hostile Tone Markers

**What it is**: Capitalization, excessive punctuation, sarcasm, condescension

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "WHY can't you just..." | Caps feel like shouting |
| "Fine. Whatever." | Passive-aggressive dismissal |
| "Oh, so NOW you care?" | Sarcasm implies bad faith |
| "Thanks SO much for nothing" | Sarcasm + accusation |
| "???" or "!!!" | Aggressive punctuation |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- Remove caps, excessive punctuation
- Replace sarcasm with **direct statement**
- Express frustration through **"I feel"** not attacks

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "WHY can't you just be on time???" | "I need you to be on time. Can you confirm 5pm?" |
| "Fine. Whatever." | "I disagree, but I'll move forward with your suggestion" |
| "Oh, so NOW you care?" | "I'm glad you're engaged with this" |
| "Thanks SO much for nothing" | "I was hoping for more support on this" |

---

### Pattern 6: Threats and Ultimatums

**What it is**: Coercive language that escalates stakes

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "If you don't... I'll..." | Escalates to confrontation |
| "My lawyer will hear about this" | Escalates to legal threat |
| "You'll be sorry" | Vague threat |
| "I'm documenting everything" | Implied threat of legal action |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- Express **needs and boundaries** without threats
- If legal action is genuinely needed, keep it factual
- Focus on **desired outcome** not punishment

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "If you're late again, I'm calling my lawyer" | "Consistent pickup times are important. Can we agree on 5pm?" |
| "You'll regret this" | "This decision concerns me. Can we discuss?" |
| "I'm documenting everything" | "I'd like to have a record of our agreement" |

---

### Pattern 7: Mind Reading and Assumptions

**What it is**: Assuming intent or motivation without evidence

**Examples**:
| Hostile | Why It Escalates |
|---------|------------------|
| "You're doing this on purpose" | Assumes malicious intent |
| "You just want to hurt me" | Projects motivation |
| "You don't care about the kids" | Attacks character based on assumption |
| "I know what you're really thinking" | Claims to know internal state |

**Rewrite Strategy**:

- **Ask** instead of assuming
- Describe **observable behavior** not assumed motivation
- Use **curious tone** not accusatory

**Rewrite Examples**:
| Hostile | Rewritten |
|---------|-----------|
| "You're doing this on purpose" | "I'm confused by this decision. Can you explain your thinking?" |
| "You don't care about the kids" | "I'm concerned about this situation. Can we discuss what's best for them?" |
| "You just want to control everything" | "I'd like more input on these decisions" |

## Healthy Communication Patterns

### Pattern A: Specific and Current

**What it looks like**: Focused on the present situation with concrete details

**Examples**:
| Healthy | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Friday's pickup is at 5pm. Can you confirm?" | Specific, actionable, non-accusatory |
| "Emma has a doctor's appointment Thursday at 3pm" | Informational, no implied criticism |
| "I need the permission slip signed by Wednesday" | Clear deadline, clear request |

---

### Pattern B: Child-Centered Framing

**What it looks like**: Focuses on children's needs, not parental grievances

**Examples**:
| Healthy | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Jake needs help with his science project this week" | About child's need, not parent's failure |
| "She seems anxious about the transition. Ideas?" | Collaborative problem-solving |
| "What activities does he enjoy at your place?" | Genuine curiosity, not interrogation |

---

### Pattern C: "I" Statements

**What it looks like**: Expresses personal experience without accusation

**Examples**:
| Healthy | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "I feel concerned when plans change last-minute" | Owns the feeling, doesn't accuse |
| "I need more notice for schedule changes" | States need, not blame |
| "I'm confused about the arrangement" | Admits uncertainty, invites clarification |

---

### Pattern D: Collaborative Language

**What it looks like**: Invites joint problem-solving

**Examples**:
| Healthy | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Can we discuss the holiday schedule?" | Opens dialogue |
| "What works best for you?" | Shows flexibility |
| "How should we handle this?" | Frames as shared problem |
| "I'd like to find a solution that works for both of us" | Explicitly collaborative |

---

### Pattern E: Acknowledgment Before Disagreement

**What it looks like**: Validates before countering

**Examples**:
| Healthy | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "I understand your concern. My perspective is..." | Shows listening before disagreeing |
| "That's a good point. I also think..." | Acknowledges validity |
| "I see why you'd want that. What if we tried..." | Validates, then proposes alternative |

## AI Rewrite Guidelines

### Preserve Intent Checklist

When rewriting a hostile message, ensure:

- [ ] The **core request or concern** is maintained
- [ ] The sender's **emotional truth** is acknowledged (to them, not in message)
- [ ] The **urgency level** is appropriate (don't minimize genuine urgency)
- [ ] The sender's **voice** is recognizable (don't make Mike sound like Sarah)
- [ ] **Autonomy** is preserved (suggestions, not mandates)

### When NOT to Intervene

AI should **allow messages through** when:

- Message is already constructive
- Minor tone issues that don't escalate
- Sender has established healthy patterns (learned behavior)
- Context shows it's a benign exchange

### When to Definitely Block

AI should **block and offer rewrite** when:

- Message contains threats
- Message attacks character
- Message weaponizes children
- Message uses hostile tone markers (caps, excessive punctuation)
- Message brings up irrelevant past grievances

### Rewrite Quality Standards

Good rewrites should be:

1. **Shorter** than or equal to original (remove noise)
2. **Actionable** (clear what's being asked)
3. **Neutral** (no blame, no sarcasm)
4. **Specific** (concrete, not vague)
5. **Authentic** (sounds like the sender, not a lawyer)

## Example Transformations

### Complex Example 1: Multi-Pattern Hostile Message

**Original** (Sarah to Mike):

> "You're ALWAYS late!!! She told me you didn't even make her lunch yesterday. This is EXACTLY like when you forgot her birthday. I'm documenting everything for my lawyer."

**Pattern Analysis**:

- Always/Never statement
- Triangulation (child as reporter)
- Past weaponization
- Hostile tone (caps, punctuation)
- Threat (lawyer)

**Rewrite Option 1** (Direct):

> "I need you to be on time for pickups. Can we also coordinate on lunch plans for school days?"

**Rewrite Option 2** (Slightly warmer):

> "Pickup punctuality is important to me. Also, can we talk about lunch coordination so she's covered every day?"

**Educational Tip to Show Sender**:

> "Your message contained an 'always' statement and referenced the past. Focusing on the specific current need makes it easier to resolve."

---

### Complex Example 2: Brief but Harsh Message

**Original** (Mike to Sarah):

> "No."

**Pattern Analysis**:

- Too brief - comes across as dismissive
- No explanation or alternative
- (Mike's communication style - efficient but harsh)

**Rewrite Option 1** (Add context):

> "No, that doesn't work for me this week. Can we find another time?"

**Rewrite Option 2** (Explain + alternative):

> "I can't do Tuesday. Would Thursday work instead?"

**Educational Tip to Show Sender**:

> "Brief responses can feel dismissive. Adding a short explanation or alternative helps keep the conversation productive."

---

### Complex Example 3: Passive-Aggressive Message

**Original**:

> "Fine. Do whatever you want. You always do anyway."

**Pattern Analysis**:

- Passive-aggressive dismissal ("Fine")
- Mind reading ("You always do anyway")
- Resignation that implies resentment

**Rewrite Option 1** (Direct disagreement):

> "I disagree with this approach. Can we discuss alternatives?"

**Rewrite Option 2** (Express concern):

> "I'm not comfortable with this plan. What if we tried [alternative]?"

**Educational Tip to Show Sender**:

> "Passive-aggressive responses often mask real concerns. Expressing your disagreement directly is more likely to lead to resolution."
