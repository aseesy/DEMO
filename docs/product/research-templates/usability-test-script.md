## Introduction Script

> "Thank you for helping us today. We're testing a co-parenting communication app called LiaiZen, and we want to see how easy it is to use.
>
> **Important**: We're testing the product, not you. If something is confusing, that's the product's fault, not yours. Your honest feedback helps us make it better.
>
> I'm going to ask you to complete some tasks. As you work through them, please think aloud - tell me what you're looking at, what you're thinking, what you expect to happen, and what you're trying to do. There are no wrong answers.
>
> I might stay quiet sometimes to let you work through things on your own. That's normal - I'm not allowed to give hints, but I'm taking notes on everything you say.
>
> Do you have any questions before we start?"

## Facilitator Neutral Responses

Use these when participants ask for help:

- "What would you do if I weren't here?"
- "What do you think that means?"
- "Where would you expect to find that?"
- "What are you thinking right now?"
- "Take your best guess."
- "There's no wrong answer - just try something."

**Avoid**:

- "That's right" or "Good job"
- "Try clicking on [specific element]"
- "That button does [explanation]"
- Any indication of success or failure
