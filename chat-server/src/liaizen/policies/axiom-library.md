# LiaiZen Axiom Library
Defines all structural communication patterns recognized by the LiaiZen Mediation Engine.

Each Axiom activates when ALL THREE conditions are satisfied:

1. **Pattern Match Condition**
2. **Structural Integrity Condition**
3. **Context Alignment Condition** (only for contextual Axioms)

Axioms guide the 1-2-3 Coaching Framework and support clarity, stability, and forward movement.

# 100-Series — Indirect Communication Patterns

Patterns where meaning is delivered indirectly, creating friction, ambiguity, or mixed signals.

## **Axiom 101 — Embedded Attribution**
A statement references a third party while indirectly assigning responsibility or evaluation to the Receiver.

## **Axiom 102 — Conditional Offering**
An offer appears collaborative but structurally creates pressure or obligation.

## **Axiom 103 — Loaded Inquiry**
A question presents as neutral but contains embedded criticism or assumption.

## **Axiom 104 — Reversing Agreement**
A message begins with agreement before structurally negating it.

## **Axiom 105 — Self-Elevation**
The Sender inserts self-praise during a logistical or conflict-related exchange.

## **Axiom 107 — Pre-Positioning**
A pre-emptive disclaimer is followed by a contradiction ("I'm not trying to… but…").

## **Axiom 108 — Reluctant Consent**
Agreement delivered with embedded hesitation or resistance.

## **Axiom 110 — Intermediary Projection**
Criticism or direction is delivered through a third party ("the kids said…").

## **Axiom 112 — Post-Event Inspection**
A question or concern is raised immediately after the Receiver's event, functioning as evaluation.

## **Axiom 116 — Hypothetical Confrontation**
A hypothetical scenario is used to indirectly critique the Receiver's behavior.

---

# 200-Series — Contextual Patterns
Patterns that activate only when specific structural contexts are present.

## **C201 — Positional Leverage**
Structural advantages (distance, scheduling, logistics) are used to reinforce a stance.

## **C202 — Relationship Transition Sensitivity**
New relationships or household changes shift the communication domain.

## **C205 — Fresh Separation Volatility**
Heightened structural intensity shortly after separation.

## **C207 — Financial Influence**
Financial offers or references modify relational balance.

---

# 300-Series — Direct Clean Patterns
Patterns that represent clarity, groundedness, and forward movement.

## **D301 — Clean Request**
A specific, actionable request clearly expressed.

## **D302 — Clean Information**
Neutral, factual information aligned with the topic.

---

# 400-Series — Structural Risk Patterns
Patterns that increase the risk of misunderstanding or coordination issues.

## **Axiom 401 — Multi-Target Overload**
Multiple unrelated topics combined into one message.

## **Axiom 402 — Ambiguous Actor**
Responsibility or agency is unclear ("this needs to be handled").

## **Axiom 403 — Unbounded Request**
A request lacks scope, timing, or specificity.

## **Axiom 404 — Implicit Expectation**
Expectations implied rather than clearly stated.

---

# 500-Series — Clarity & Ambiguity Patterns
Patterns that destabilize meaning or create interpretive ambiguity.

## **Axiom 501 — Ambiguous Referent**
Pronouns or deictic terms lack clear antecedents.

## **Axiom 502 — Temporal Blurring**
Unanchored timing references ("later", "next time").

## **Axiom 503 — Undefined Standard**
Evaluations without criteria ("handled properly").

## **Axiom 504 — Scalar Stretching**
Globalizing terms ("always", "never", "every time").

---

# 600-Series — Relational Positioning Patterns
Patterns that shift balance or roles in communication.

## **Axiom 601 — Upward Positioning**
Sender assumes evaluator or authority stance.

## **Axiom 602 — Downward Positioning**
Sender adopts deferential, approval-seeking posture.

## **Axiom 603 — Role Drift**
Sender steps into an inappropriate relational role (judge, therapist, etc.).

## **Axiom 604 — Responsibility Dispersion**
Responsibility is distributed without clarity ("we need to…").

---

# 700-Series — Momentum Patterns
Patterns that affect conversational progress.

## **Axiom 701 — Lateral Movement**
Topic shifts horizontally without addressing the active thread.

## **Axiom 702 — Vertical Movement**
Escalation to broader themes instead of addressing the immediate topic.

## **Axiom 703 — Looping**
Repetition of prior statements without added clarity.

## **Axiom 704 — Resolution Drop**
Introducing new concerns before completing the previous one.

---

# 800-Series — Integrity Patterns
Patterns that affect coherence, channel appropriateness, or message stability.

## **Axiom 801 — Content/Medium Mismatch**
Message contains content too complex or high-stakes for text.

## **Axiom 802 — Meaning Overload**
Multiple intentions compressed into a single statement.

## **Axiom 803 — Selective Address**
Responding only to fragments of previous messages.

## **Axiom 804 — Unanchored Directive**
Instruction without setup or contextual grounding.

# IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

- Each Axiom corresponds to a set of pattern-detection rules.
- Axioms operate independently but may activate in clusters.
- Higher-priority Axioms guide the Mediation Protocol.
- Use Observation Domains for detection features.
- Pair Axioms with rewrite templates and idiolect models.
