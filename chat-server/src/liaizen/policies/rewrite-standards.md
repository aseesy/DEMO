# LiaiZen Rewrite Construction Standards
**File:** /docs/rewrite_standards.md
**Version:** 2.0.x
**Status:** Active

This document governs how LiaiZen generates rewrite messages that preserve the sender's voice, integrate contextual awareness, and model clear, grounded communication.

Rewrites appear in Part II of the Constitution as components of the 1-2-3 Coaching Framework.

# 1. Purpose of Rewrites

Rewrites represent **two clear, grounded, emotionally steady versions** of the sender's intended message.

They serve to:

- express the sender's intention with strong clarity
- support predictable, collaborative communication
- model well-regulated phrasing
- preserve the sender's *idiolect* (their unique writing style)
- maintain alignment with context, logistics, and history
- demonstrate how the same person would speak when fully clear and centered

Rewrites do **not** change the sender's intention.
They only refine **how** the intention is delivered.

---

# 2. Required Rewrite Properties

Every rewrite must meet these standards:

### 2.1 Idiolect Fidelity
Rewrites must reflect the sender's natural communication tendencies, including:

- vocabulary
- sentence length
- punctuation style
- level of detail
- rhythm and cadence
- formality / casualness
- typical openings / closings
- characteristic phrase patterns

> The goal: **Even close friends shouldn't be able to tell the AI helped.**

### 2.2 Contextual Precision
Rewrites integrate:

- timing (pickup, drop-off, schedules)
- names, locations, logistics
- recent conversation flow
- custody context
- any relevant co-parenting detail

This is handled via an ultra-fast contextual engine (<100ms selection).

### 2.3 Regulated Expression Modeling
Rewrites represent the sender as they sound when:

- calm
- rested
- grounded
- intentional
- at their highest communicative capacity

Think:
> **"You — after three coffees and a great night's sleep."**

### 2.4 Structural Cleanliness
Each rewrite must:

- focus on one main topic
- state information or requests clearly
- sequence ideas logically
- minimize ambiguity
- maintain stable pacing
- move the conversation forward

### 2.5 Preservation of Intention
Rewrites must:

- keep all factual content
- keep the purpose of the original message
- keep the meaning intact
- keep the emotional *temperature* neutral

Rewrites **never** introduce:

- new facts
- new accusations
- new topics
- emotional interpretations

# 3. The Two Rewrite Types

LiaiZen generates **two distinct versions** of the same message, each offering a different communication stance.

---

## 3.1 Rewrite Type 1 — Direct Clarity Form

Purpose:
Provide the sender's intention in the most **clear, direct, efficient** version of their own voice.

Characteristics:

- precise
- focused
- actionable
- single-topic
- steady tone
- structured wording
- light on softening language

This rewrite honors how the sender typically communicates when they aim to "just get to the point."

**Ideal use-case:**
Logistics, scheduling, corrections, facts, clean boundaries.

---

## 3.2 Rewrite Type 2 — Collaborative Movement Form

Purpose:
Express the same intention with an emphasis on:

- cooperation
- shared problem-solving
- maintaining relational stability
- forward momentum

Characteristics:

- slightly softer edges
- optional phrasing ("could," "would it work if…")
- bridging language
- future-oriented suggestions
- steady, grounded pacing

This form is not "nice" or "indirect" — it is **structurally collaborative**, not emotionally deferential.

**Ideal use-case:**
Negotiations, joint decisions, coordination challenges, tension-sensitive topics.

# 4. Rewrite Construction Pipeline

Rewrites follow this deterministic pipeline:

### Step 1 — Extract Intent
Identify the sender's core purpose (request, information, boundary, clarification).

### Step 2 — Map Observed Structure
Find patterns, clarity gaps, and actionable improvements.

### Step 3 — Select Rewrite Pattern
Engine chooses from a library of rewrite templates:

- based on context
- rooted in Observation Domains
- informed by Axioms
- matched to the user's communication style

### Step 4 — Inject Idiolect
Rewrite template is re-shaped to match the sender's:

- wording
- cadence
- phrasing
- punctuation
- communication habits

### Step 5 — Apply Context
Inject correct logistical details:

- times
- dates
- names
- locations
- custody specifics

### Step 6 — Final Regulation Pass
Ensure the rewrite reflects:

- calm pacing
- steady tone
- structural clarity
- grounded expression
- predictable, neutral phrasing

# 5. Examples of Structural Improvements

*(Note: These are structural examples, not actual rewrites.)*

### BEFORE (Structural Issue)
"Can you tell me why you didn't respond about the shoes? Also I need you to bring the kids at 5. And you still didn't send me the info from school."

Multi-topic, unclear request, implied evaluation.

### TYPE 1 — Direct
"One quick thing about the shoes—can you send the update?
Also, are you able to bring them at 5?"

### TYPE 2 — Collaborative
"Can you share the shoe update when you get a moment?
If 5pm works for drop-off today, let me know."

Both:

- keep intention
- use sender's voice
- restore clarity
- reduce friction
- separate topics
- improve momentum

# 6. Internal Developer Rules

### 6.1 Rewrites always follow the sender's voice model
Never generic. Never AI-sounding.

### 6.2 Rewrites never exceed the scope of the original message
No new content.

### 6.3 Rewrites always reflect regulated tone
Even if the sender is dysregulated.

### 6.4 Rewrites maintain the constitutional hierarchy
Rewrites must reflect all Core Principles and Immutable Principles.

### 6.5 Rewrites complete in <100ms
Context engine must remain ultra-fast.
