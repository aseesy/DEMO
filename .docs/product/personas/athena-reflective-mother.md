## Likely Behaviors in App

### Message Patterns
- May write **longer, explanatory messages** to avoid misunderstanding
- Uses **"just to clarify"** language frequently
- Structures messages with **logical reasoning**
- May **over-apologize** when making requests
- Tries to **frame everything as collaborative**

### Trigger Words She Uses
| Word/Phrase | Underlying Emotion | Risk |
|-------------|-------------------|------|
| "just to clarify" | Wanting to ensure understanding | Sounds like correction |
| "for Vira's sake" | Child-centered thinking | Can sound manipulative |
| "I think we should" | Collaborative suggestion | Can sound like direction |
| "to make sure" | Seeking confirmation | Can sound like micromanagement |
| "I want to ensure" | Responsibility and care | Can sound controlling |

### Response to AI Suggestions
- May initially **resist shorter messages** (feels incomplete)
- More receptive to suggestions framed as **"this preserves your intent but reduces defensiveness"**
- Responds well to **"this version is clearer without sounding directive"**
- May need validation that **her concerns are legitimate** before accepting suggestions

## What Athena Needs From LiaiZen

### Core Needs
1. **Tools for structure** - Documentation, recordkeeping, clear timestamps, confirmation systems
2. **Shared calendars** - Version tracking of plans
3. **Tools for neutral communication** - Ways to express needs without sounding controlling
4. **Validation of legitimate concerns** - Recognition that her requests aren't "too much"
5. **Protection from mischaracterization** - Help communicating in ways that can't be weaponized

### AI Coaching Language for Athena

| Instead of... | Try framing as... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "This sounds controlling" | "This version preserves your intent while reducing defensiveness" |
| "You're over-explaining" | "This shorter version maintains clarity without the extra context" |
| "That's too long" | "Here's a version that's direct while still being respectful" |
| "Don't apologize" | "This version states your need without apology" |

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Micro-UI element**: "This message may be perceived as directive"
- **Tone indicator**: Show when clarifying language reads as correction
- **Structure tools**: Clear documentation, timestamps, version tracking
- **Validation**: Acknowledge legitimate concerns before suggesting changes

---

## Success Criteria for Athena

| Metric | Current State | Target State |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Messages perceived as controlling | Frequent | Rare |
| Over-explanation frequency | High | Low |
| Confidence in requests | Low (second-guessing) | High |
| Being mischaracterized | Frequent | Rare |
| Mutual respect in communication | Inconsistent | Consistent |

## Jobs-to-be-Done (Athena-Specific)

1. **When** I need to clarify an agreement, **I want to** confirm understanding **so that** we avoid future conflict.

2. **When** I'm making a request, **I want to** express it clearly **so that** I'm not seen as controlling or combative.

3. **When** I need to discuss Vira's needs, **I want to** frame it logically **so that** we can make child-centered decisions.

4. **When** I feel my words might be misunderstood, **I want to** communicate in a way **so that** my intent is clear and can't be weaponized.

5. **When** I need structure and predictability, **I want to** document agreements **so that** we have clarity and accountability.

## Design Implications

### For UX
- **Structure tools** - Documentation, calendars, version tracking
- **Clear timestamps** - For accountability and recordkeeping
- **Confirmation systems** - Ways to verify agreements
- **Neutral prompts** - Language that doesn't sound directive
- **Validation** - Acknowledge legitimate concerns

### For Onboarding

## Relationship to Yashir

### Dynamic Summary
| Athena's Perspective | Yashir's Perspective |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| "I'm clarifying to ensure understanding" | "She's correcting me" |
| "I want logical, child-centered decisions" | "She's telling me what to do" |
| "I need structure and predictability" | "She's trying to control me" |
| "I'm trying to avoid escalation" | "She's attacking me" |

### Communication Loop to Break
```
Athena: Clarifying/logical message →
Yashir: Perceives as correction/direction →
Yashir: Defensive/combative response →
Athena: Over-explains to clarify intent →
Yashir: Perceives as more control →
[Loop continues]
```

### LiaiZen's Role
**Not to take sides** - but to help break the loop by:
- Helping Athena communicate clarity without sounding directive
- Helping Yashir receive information without perceiving attack
- Creating space for both to be heard and respected
