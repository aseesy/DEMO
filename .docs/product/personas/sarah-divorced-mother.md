## Communication Struggles & Real Costs

### The Endless Conflict Cycle
Every message exchange spirals into multi-day arguments where old grievances resurface. A simple "Can you pick up Emma early on Friday?" becomes "You NEVER help when I need you" and devolves into rehashing who forgot whose soccer game two years ago. They haven't successfully resolved a single scheduling conflict without fighting in over a year.

### Financial Drain
- Spent **$8,000 in attorney fees this year** just to mediate communication breakdowns
- Lawyer bills **$400/hour** to translate her emotional texts into something reasonable
- One heated text exchange cost her **$1,200** when her attorney had to intervene

### Lost Relationship with Kids
- 10-year-old daughter refuses to tell her about school events because "it always starts a fight with Dad"
- Missed daughter's piano recital because ex-husband claimed he "never got the message" about date change
- Text thread shows he did receive it - buried in an argument about summer vacation

### Constant Battle Mentality
Can't communicate about anything without it becoming a battle:
- Asking about medication schedules turns into accusations
- Sharing teacher feedback becomes blame warfare
- Every interaction leaves her shaking with anger and regret

### Drowning in the Past
- Can't discuss anything current without ex dragging up things from years ago
- A conversation about Emma's math tutor becomes "Well you're the one who..." referencing 2019
- Exhausted from fighting the same battles repeatedly

### No Productive Outcomes
- After 18 months, still haven't figured out how to make a single decision together
- Every conversation ends in stalemate or one parent unilaterally deciding out of frustration
- Kids suffer because parents cannot communicate effectively

| Screenshots messages obsessively | Always | Anticipates needing proof later |

## Goals

### Primary Goals
1. Communicate about children's needs without every exchange becoming a war
2. Stop wasting thousands of dollars on attorney mediation for basic communication
3. Rebuild trust with daughter that it's safe to share information between households
4. Reach actual decisions and agreements instead of endless conflict loops
5. Discuss present-day issues without the past being weaponized

### Underlying Need
**Sarah needs to feel safe communicating with her ex** - safe that her words won't be twisted, safe that a simple question won't start a war, safe that she can focus on her kids instead of managing conflict.

## Design Implications

### For AI Mediation
- Needs **pre-send intervention** - catch hostile messages before they go out
- Requires **educational component** - teach why certain phrases escalate
- Must **preserve her intent** while improving delivery
- Should recognize **"always/never" statements** as red flags

### For UX
- Mobile-first - she uses smartphone primarily
- **Low cognitive load** - she's already stressed
- **Quick actions** - don't make her think harder than necessary
- **Calm visual design** - don't add to her anxiety

### For Onboarding
- **Fast signup** - Google OAuth preferred
- **No lengthy tutorials** - she's too stressed for learning
- **Quick first value** - show AI mediation working immediately
- **Invite flow** - needs to bring ex-husband into the platform
