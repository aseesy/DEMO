---

## Background & Context

Ben worked as the breadwinner throughout the marriage and views family responsibilities through a lens of duty and obligation. He originally wanted multiple children for a larger family, and interpreted Erika's resistance to more children as personal betrayal.

This core wound - feeling that he sacrificed and carried the burden while Erika "broke" - shapes how he communicates today.

---

## Psychological Drivers

| Driver | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Need for reliability** | Strong need for predictability and consistency |
| **Financial = moral weight** | Equates provision with moral contribution ("I supported everyone") |
| **Fairness sensitivity** | Can feel resentment if he perceives unequal contribution |
| **Action-based trust** | Measures commitment through action, consistency, and sacrifice |
| **Control for stability** | Believes he must maintain control to preserve stability |

### Core Wound
> "I carried the burden and you broke"

Ben feels unappreciated for the financial and logistical sacrifices he made. He struggles to acknowledge invisible labor (emotional, mental health) that doesn't fit his framework of contribution.

## Communication Style

### Characteristics
| Trait | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Direct** | Gets to the point quickly |
| **Dismissive tendency** | Can minimize others' perspectives |
| **"Stating facts"** | Believes he's being objective when he's often asserting emotional interpretations |
| **Low empathy language** | Struggles to acknowledge emotional dimensions |
| **Reframing** | May unconsciously reframe situations to minimize Erika's perspective |
| **Invalidating** | Sometimes invalidates experiences, especially mental health related |

### Example Messages (Unmediated)

| What He Types | What He Means | How Erika Hears It |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| "I need reliability on this" | "I want to be able to count on the plan" | "You're unreliable" |
| "As usual, I'll handle it" | "I'm stepping up again" | "You never handle anything" |
| "Can you just confirm?" | "I need a clear answer" | "You're being evasive" |
| "This is what actually happened" | "Let me clarify" | "Your version is wrong" |

---

## Pain Points

| Pain Point | Impact |
|------------|--------|
| Feels unappreciated | Resentment builds when contribution isn't acknowledged |
| Overresponsible | Carries weight of being the "reliable" one |
| Trust issues | Struggles after Erika's alcoholism incident |
| Can't acknowledge her struggles | Difficulty seeing emotional labor as real contribution |
| Control need | When things feel unstable, tightens grip |

---

## Likely Behaviors in App

### Message Patterns
- May write messages with **tone of moral judgment**
- Pushes for **decisive, efficient answers**
- May **dismiss suggestions** that promote emotional nuance
- Uses **guilt or burden-implying phrasing** unintentionally
- Frames requests as **obligations** rather than collaboration

### Trigger Words He Uses
| Word/Phrase | Underlying Emotion | Risk |
|-------------|-------------------|------|
| "responsibility" | Resentment about carrying load | Implies Erika isn't responsible |
| "reliable" / "again" | Frustration with past | Implies she's unreliable |
| "as usual" | Accumulated resentment | Dismissive, accusatory |
| "actually" | Correcting the record | Invalidating her version |
| "I need" | Asserting control | Can sound like demands |

### Response to AI Suggestions
- May initially **resist emotional reframes** as "soft"
- More receptive to suggestions framed as **efficiency** or **clarity**
- Responds well to **"this will prevent back-and-forth"** framing
- May need to see **results** (fewer conflicts) before trusting AI

## What Ben Needs From LiaiZen

### Core Needs
1. **Messaging reframes that preserve authority but remove condescension**
2. **Gentle prompts encouraging collaborative rather than hierarchical decision-making**
3. **Validation of actual intent while reducing unintended emotional impact**
4. **Support in recognizing when statements shift from logistical to accusatory**

### AI Coaching Language for Ben

| Instead of... | Try framing as... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| "This sounds judgmental" | "Let's restate this in a way that assumes good intent rather than error" |
| "Be nicer" | "This version focuses on the logistics without the history" |
| "That's harsh" | "Here's a version that invites collaboration rather than compliance" |
| "Don't be dismissive" | "This reframe keeps your point but removes the implied criticism" |

### UI/UX Considerations
- **Micro-UI element**: "This message may be perceived as accusatory"
- **Tone indicator**: Show when efficiency language reads as coldness
- **History detection**: Flag when past-referencing language appears
- **Collaboration prompts**: Suggest "we" instead of "I need you to"

## Success Criteria for Ben

| Metric | Current State | Target State |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| Messages perceived as accusatory | Frequent | Rare |
| Collaborative language use | Low | High |
| Time to resolution on logistics | Extended (due to conflict) | Quick |
| Erika's defensive responses | Frequent | Rare |
| Trust rebuilt over time | Low | Improving |

## Jobs-to-be-Done (Ben-Specific)

1. **When** I need to confirm logistics, **I want to** get a clear answer quickly **so that** I can plan reliably.

2. **When** I feel frustrated by past patterns, **I want to** express my concern **so that** things improve without starting a fight.

3. **When** I'm stating what I see as facts, **I want to** be understood **so that** we can move forward efficiently.

4. **When** decisions need to be made, **I want to** reach resolution **so that** the kids have stability.

5. **When** I feel like I'm carrying the load, **I want to** be acknowledged **so that** I don't feel alone in this.

## Design Implications

### For AI Mediation
- Detect **burden/responsibility language** and offer neutral alternatives
- Recognize **"stating facts" pattern** that contains emotional assertions
- Preserve his **directness** while removing **implied judgment**
- Frame suggestions as **increasing efficiency**, not "being nicer"

### For UX
- **Don't lecture** - he'll disengage
- **Show results** - he responds to evidence it's working
- **Efficiency framing** - "This will reduce back-and-forth"
- **Authority preservation** - don't make him feel corrected

### For Onboarding
- Position AI as **clarity tool**, not emotion coach
- Emphasize **getting to resolution faster**
- Show how it **prevents misunderstandings**
- Avoid therapy language - use logistics language

## Relationship to Erika

### Dynamic Summary
| Ben's Perspective | Erika's Perspective |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "I carried the burden and you broke" | "I carried an invisible burden you never saw" |
| Feels betrayed by her resistance to second child | Felt pressured into second child |
| Measures contribution by action and provision | Values emotional labor and mental health |
| Wants efficiency and reliability | Wants emotional safety and respect |

### Communication Loop to Break
```
Ben: Direct/efficient message →
Erika: Perceives as judgment/accusation →
Erika: Defensive/apologetic response →
Ben: Perceives as avoidance/unreliability →
Ben: More assertive message →
[Loop continues]
```

### LiaiZen's Role
**Not to take sides** - but to gently unblock the loop of historic resentment by:
- Helping Ben communicate authority without condescension
- Helping Erika receive logistics without perceiving attack
- Creating space for both to be heard
