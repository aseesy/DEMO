## Background & Context

Erika wanted to maintain a smaller family due to personal limits, but felt pressured into having a second child out of relational duty. She developed severe postpartum depression after Luca's birth, which eventually led to alcohol dependency.

She completed an 8-month rehab program in 2023 and is now rebuilding her life with a deep desire for **dignity, stability, and respect**. The divorce was finalized after her recovery.

## Psychological Drivers

| Driver                        | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Need for emotional safety** | Primary driver in all interactions            |
| **Fear of judgment**          | Worried about being defined by past addiction |
| **Sensitivity to inadequacy** | Hyper-aware of implications she's not capable |
| **Internalizes conflict**     | Takes criticism inward, carries it            |
| **Desire to prove herself**   | Deep need to be seen as a capable parent      |

### Core Wound

> "I carried an invisible burden you never saw"

Erika feels that her emotional and mental health struggles were never acknowledged as real labor. She was pushed past her limits and then blamed for breaking. She now lives with the fear that Ben will always see her through the lens of her lowest moment.

## What Erika Needs From LiaiZen

### Core Needs

1. **Confidence-supporting message reframes**
2. **Help asserting boundaries** respectfully
3. **Protection from language that implies blame** (in messages she receives)
4. **Communication coaching that promotes internal dignity**

### AI Coaching Language for Erika

| Instead of...            | Try framing as...                                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "Be more direct"         | "Here's a version that speaks from capability rather than apology"  |
| "You're being defensive" | "This reframe expresses your point without needing to justify it"   |
| "Stop apologizing"       | "You can make this request confidently - you have the right to ask" |
| "That's too indirect"    | "Here's a clearer version that says what you actually need"         |

### UI/UX Considerations

- **Micro-UI element**: "This message sounds apologetic or deferential"
- **Confidence indicator**: Show when language is undermining her position
- **Direct request templates**: Help her ask clearly without apology
- **Receiving help**: Interpret incoming messages charitably

## Jobs-to-be-Done (Erika-Specific)

1. **When** I need to communicate with Ben, **I want to** express myself clearly **so that** I don't come across as weak or uncertain.

2. **When** I receive a message that feels like judgment, **I want to** understand his actual intent **so that** I don't spiral into defensiveness.

### For UX

- **Supportive tone** - she's receptive to help
- **Confidence-building framing** - "You can ask for this directly"
- **Charitable interpretation** - help her read Ben's messages neutrally
- **No judgment** - she's already judging herself

### For Onboarding
